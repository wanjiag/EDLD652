## Loading data and packages

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
#ggplot2 and dplyr and redundant once tidyverse is loaded
library(colorblindr) #it would be better to comment the following command for those who haven't insremotes::install_github("clauswilke/colorblindr")

theme_set(theme_minimal())

files <- fs::dir_ls(here::here("data", "project"))

obs <- gsub(".+project/(.+)\\.csv", "\\1", files)
purrr::map2(obs, files, ~{
   assign(.x, read_csv(.y), envir = .GlobalEnv)
})
```

## How different songs’ properties influence it’s popularity?

```{r}
range(data$danceability)
range(data$duration_ms)
range(data$tempo)
range(data$speechiness)

data1 = data %>% 
  select(id, popularity, year, danceability, duration_ms, tempo, speechiness) %>% 
  mutate(duration = 
           (duration_ms-min(duration_ms))/(max(duration_ms)-min(duration_ms))) %>% 
  select(-duration_ms) %>% 
  mutate(tempo = (tempo-min(tempo))/(max(tempo)-min(tempo)))
  

fig1_data = data1 %>% select(-year) %>% 
  mutate(danceability = cut(danceability, 50, labels=FALSE),
         duration = cut(duration, 50, labels=FALSE),
         tempo = cut(tempo, 50, labels=FALSE),
         speechiness = cut(speechiness, 50, labels=FALSE)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = danceability:duration, 
               names_to = "property") %>% 
  group_by(property, value) %>% 
  summarise(popularity_median = median(popularity)) %>% 
  mutate(property = factor(property, levels=c("danceability",
                                              "tempo",
                                              "speechiness",
                                              "duration")))

ggplot(fig1_data, aes(x=value, y=popularity_median, group=property)) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = popularity_median, fill=property), alpha=0.6) + 
  labs(x = "Normalized Value (0-30)", y = "Median Popularity (0-100)") + 
  scale_fill_OkabeIto()

#To illustrate the correlation between x (normalized value of song properties) and y (song ppularity), I think geom_line() would be better than geom_ribbon(). 

#It may also be nice to use geom_smooth(method = "lm") and comparate the linear regression lines with the actual results


```

## How does songs’ properties change over time?

```{r}

fig2_data = data1 %>% 
  mutate(decades = year - year %% 10 ) %>% 
  select(-c(popularity, year)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = danceability:duration, 
               names_to = "property") %>% 
  group_by(property, decades) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(value))

ggplot(fig2_data, aes(x=decades, y=property, fill=mean)) + geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "A") + 
  labs(y="Property", x="Mean for each decade") + 
  theme(legend.position = "top")

# There doesn't seem to be an particular order in which each song property was placed. Maybe you can arrange them based on their variability, in descending order?

```


## The most popular artist over time

```{r, warning = FALSE}

library(gganimate)

artist_data = data %>%

  mutate(artists =  gsub("\\[|\\]", "", artists)) %>%

animate(fig3, fps=1)

# There was hundreds of warning messages on this part of r chunk so I had to scroll down quite a bit to actually find your plot. It's a minor inconvenience, but a little more detail on r chunks would be nice!

# It will be really cool to you show the song properties of each artist!

# Also, how is the popularity level (0-100) measured? This is more of a general comment, but a little more explanation on data would be helpful.
